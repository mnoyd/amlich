# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** Every almanac subsystem in amlich must produce output that matches KHCBPPT for the 2020–2030 date range
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Source Establishment

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: KHCBPPT as sole reference — pending edition identification (Phase 1 blocker)
- [Pre-phase]: Nạp âm scope is undecided — source_id is "tam-menh-thong-hoi" not "khcbppt"; must resolve in Phase 1 before golden dataset schema can be finalized

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 is entirely manual research — KHCBPPT edition must be pinned before any automated work is possible
- Star rule completeness: baseline.json contextual buckets have only 1 entry each; may indicate missing rules, not just incorrect values — Phase 3 validator must detect missing rules, not just mismatches
- Trực quality (`TRUC_QUALITY` const in `truc.rs`) is hardcoded in Rust source, not JSON — correction in Phase 4 requires code change + recompile
